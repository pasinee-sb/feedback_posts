# unit 24.5 Hashing and Log in exercise. 
An application that lets users sign up and log in to their own accounts. Once logged in, users can add feedback, edit their feedback, delete their feedback, and see a list of all feedback that they’ve given. Many of these routes are protected, so that for example user1 can’t edit a piece of feedback that user2 created.
